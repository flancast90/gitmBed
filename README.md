  <ol>
    <li>The bare-minimum for gitmbed content is that it contains the page contains an image element (<code><img></code>) with the HTML <code>alt</code> attribute. Inside this <code>alt</code>, you must append the arguments <code>embed src</code>, <code>embed width</code>, <code>embed height</code></li>
    <li>As stated on the <a href="https://gitmbed.finnsoftware.net">gitmbed homepage</a>, the <code>embed_width</code> and <code>embed_height</code> arguments can take either a numerical px, percent, em, or rem value. It should also be noted that the <code>embed_url</code> must be a full url, including <code>https://</code>, <code>http://</code>, or <code>file://</code>

<img width="100%" alt="gitmbed=https://musescore.com/user/35848526/scores/6907224/embed,100%,500" src="https://gitmbed.finnsoftware.net/assets/img/button_gitmbed.png"/>
